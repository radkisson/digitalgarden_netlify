# RADK

Hi, I am an Industrial Engineer, Data Analyst & Artist with experience working with grassroots non-profit organizations. 

While at university, I co-founded a music crowdfunding platform where I worked for two years. Then I co-founded a nonprofit that worked to better access artistic practices to high school students having film, theatre, and music lessons while encouraging active listening and curiosity while enabling them to create comfortably, leaving behind the competitive normativity of "formal" education.

Today, I am a member of the EVERYSEEKER Festival's Board of Directors, and I support Spanish-speaking migrants through No One is Illegal as a volunteer. Alongside this, I'm composing new songs for my new-wave, darkwave, and electropunk-influenced music projects.
