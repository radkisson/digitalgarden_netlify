**This does two things:**

-   The dg-home setting tells the plugin that this should be your home page or entry into your digital garden. (It only needs to be added to _one_ note, not every note you'll publish).
    
-   The dg-publish setting tells the plugin that this note should be published to your digital garden. Notes without this setting will not be published. (In other terms: Every note you publish will need this setting.)
    

7.  Open your command pallete by pressing CTRL+P on Windows/Linux (CMD+P on Mac) and find the "Digital Garden: Publish Single Note" command. Press enter.
8.  Go to your site's URL which you should find on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com). If nothing shows up yet, wait a minute and refresh. Your note should now appear.
